Lesson 1: How to Generate Virtual Scenarios for Test Purposes
-------------------------------------------------------------

	(a) LD (Load Demanded)

Folder: A_DT/A0_LD
M-File: 0_Data_LD.mat
Use a repmat function for the number of years needed

	(b) DG (Distributed Generator)

Folder: B_VS/B1_DG
M-File: y1a_UltimateDG
Substitute years_count on line-23 with the number of years desired

Folder: B_VS/B1_DG
M-File: y5a_SupremeDG
On line 25, the first number is the number of years to be simulated and the second number is the steps in years. Found this to be ultimately useless

Folder: B_VS/B1_DG
M-File: 1_Data_DG.mat
Everything is saved here

Folder: B_VS/B1_DG
M-File: z1a_UltimateDG.m
Will describe later

	(c) PV (Photovoltac Panels)

Folder: B_VS/B2_PV
M-File: y5b_SupremePV.m
Pretty self explanatory

	(d) WT (Wind Turbine)

Folder: B_VS/B3_WT
M-File: y5c_SupremeWT.m
Again, self explanatory. But I think what is needed is Virtual_WT_V1

	(e) EV (Electric Vehicle)
Folder: B_VS/B4_EV
M-File: y4UltimateEv.m
First number is years_count and second number is parks_count
